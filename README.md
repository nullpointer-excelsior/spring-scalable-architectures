# 🚀 Scalable High-Performing Architectures with Spring

This repository contains various architectural styles to create highly scalable, maintainable, and high-performing applications based on a checkout-app and Spring.

## 🏛️ [Monolith](monolith/README.md)

In this architectural style, all components are developed within the same application. This results in a single deployable unit, which simplifies development and deployment but may present challenges in scalability and maintainability as the application grows.

## 🔗 [Microservices](microservices/README.md)

In this architectural style, the application is decomposed into multiple independently deployable services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business capability and communicates with other services via APIs. This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility but introduces challenges in inter-service communication, data consistency, and deployment complexity.
