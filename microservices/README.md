# üîó Microservices

This code represents a microservices-based e-commerce application, specifically focusing on the **Cart** and **Products** modules, along with an **API Gateway** for managing requests. Each module operates as an independent service, communicating via REST APIs.

## üìÇ General Structure:

### üîπ Microservices Architecture:
- The application is divided into independent services: **Cart Service** and **Products Service**.
- Each service has its own database and is responsible for a specific domain.
- Services communicate via **REST APIs** and are orchestrated by an **API Gateway**.
- Uses **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for service routing and request management.
- Leverages a **Config Server** to manage centralized, externalized configuration for all microservices, ensuring consistent settings across environments.
- Incorporates **Eureka Server** as a **Service Discovery** mechanism, allowing services to dynamically register and discover each other without hardcoded endpoints.
- Integrates **Spring Security** at the **API Gateway** level to centralize authentication and authorization across all services (basic authentication is used for simplicity, as the focus is on the microservices architecture rather than advanced security mechanisms).
- **Resilience**: Implements the **Circuit Breaker** pattern using **Resilience4j** tool to improve fault tolerance. If a service becomes unavailable or unresponsive, the circuit breaker prevents further calls to it for a period of time, allowing the system to degrade gracefully and recover more effectively.

## üåê Core Components:

### üõí Cart Service:
- Manages shopping carts for users.
- Supports cart creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Uses **CartEntity, CartProductEntity, CartUserEntity** for persistence.
- Mappers (**CartMapper, CartProductMapper, CartUserMapper**) convert between entities and models.
- REST Controller (**CartRestController**) exposes cart-related endpoints.
- Service (**CartService**) contains business logic.
- Stores data in its own **Cart Database**.

### üè¨ Products Service:
- Manages product information and inventory.
- Updates stock quantities after purchases.
- Uses **ProductEntity** for persistence.
- REST Controller (**ProductRestController**) exposes product-related endpoints.
- Service (**ProductService**) contains business logic.
- Stores data in its own **Products Database**.

### üöÄ API Gateway:
- Serves as a single entry point for all client requests.
- Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Provides security, rate limiting, and logging features.
- Uses **Spring Cloud Gateway** for dynamic routing and load balancing.
- Defines routes for **Cart** and **Products** services.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config Server:
- Centralized configuration service using **Spring Cloud Config Server**.
- Manages external properties for all microservices from a shared Git repository or local file system.
- Enables consistent and environment-specific configuration management.
- Supports dynamic configuration updates without requiring service redeployment.
- The **Config Server** is deployed behind an **NGINX-based load balancer** to ensure high availability and distribute configuration requests efficiently across multiple instances.

### üß≠ Service Discovery:
- **Service Discovery** allows services to register themselves and discover other services dynamically at runtime.
- **Eureka Client** in each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server upon startup and periodically sends heartbeat signals to stay active in the registry.
- Simplifies service communication by removing the need for hardcoded URLs, enabling resilient, fault-tolerant, and scalable service interactions.


### üèõÔ∏è Legacy Service:
- In some scenarios, fully migrating away from a monolithic architecture isn't feasible due to time, risk, or cost constraints.
- The **legacy-monolith** acts as a centralized system that retains functionalities equivalent to those in the microservices (e.g., product management, cart operations).
- It serves as a **fallback mechanism** during service outages, ensuring continuity of service and improved resilience.
- While the long-term goal may be to decompose the monolith, its presence provides stability and acts as a bridge during the transition to a fully distributed system.

## üîó Service Communication:

- The **Gateway** is the contact point for clients.
- To access product information, the client makes a request to the Gateway (`/products/**`), which then routes it to the **Products Microservice** (running on `http://localhost:8081`).
- To interact with shopping carts, the client makes a request to the Gateway (`/carts/**`), which then routes it to the **Cart Microservice** (running on `http://localhost:8082`).
- The **Products** and **Cart** microservices are independent of each other in this shown architecture. No direct communication between them is observed in the provided files.

## üìäüîç Observability

Observability is a critical aspect of microservices architecture, as it enables teams to detect, understand, and resolve issues quickly in highly distributed systems. In a microservices environment, failures can occur in isolated services or as part of complex inter-service communication. Without proper observability, diagnosing such issues becomes challenging and time-consuming.

When the microservice stack is Up you can access the Grafana dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to monitor the application's observability data in real time. The system integrates the following tools:

- **Prometheus** for collecting and querying metrics.
- **Loki** for centralized logging and log aggregation.
- **Tempo** for distributed tracing and visualization of request flows across microservices.

These tools work together to provide a comprehensive view of the system's performance, logs, and traces, all accessible through a unified Grafana interface.

## üë®‚Äçüöí High Availability

In microservices architecture, **high availability** is crucial to ensure that systems remain operational and responsive even when individual components fail. A resilient system can gracefully handle service outages, minimize downtime, and provide fallback mechanisms to preserve user experience and business continuity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config Server

The **Config Server** is essential because all microservices depend on it to retrieve their configuration, so it must be deployed with **high availability** to avoid service disruptions.

#### Load Balancer

The **Config Server** is deployed with **two active instances** to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance. These instances are fronted by a **server-side load balancer implemented with NGINX**, which distributes incoming configuration requests evenly across the available instances. This strategy ensures continuous availability of configuration services and prevents single points of failure during runtime or deployment scenarios.

### üö™ Gateway

The **API Gateway** is a crucial component in the microservices architecture, acting as the **single entry point** for all external client requests. Given its central role, it's essential to ensure this component remains **highly available** and **resilient**, as any failure at this level could disrupt access to the entire system.


#### üö¶ Circuit Breaker

To ensure high availability and graceful degradation under failure conditions, a multi-layered **Circuit Breaker** strategy is implemented using **Resilience4j** at the API Gateway level:

- If the `products-ms` service becomes unresponsive or fails, the circuit breaker redirects all traffic to the **legacy-monolith** as a fallback (`/legacy/products`).
- If the **legacy-monolith** also fails or becomes overloaded, a secondary circuit breaker responds with a predefined fallback route (`/fallback/unavailable`) and returns a structured error message: "Checkout Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."

This approach ensures the system degrades gracefully, maintains user experience as much as possible, and avoids cascading failures across the microservices ecosystem.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer

The API Gateway uses a **load balancer** configuration to distribute requests across multiple instances of the microservices. Routes are defined with **Resilience4j circuit breakers** for fault tolerance:

- Requests to `/products/**` are load balanced to `products-ms` instances (`lb://products-ms`) with a circuit breaker that falls back to the legacy service (`/legacy/products`) if the product service fails.
- Requests to `/carts/**` are routed to `cart-ms` instances (`lb://cart-ms`) with a circuit breaker that falls back to a predefined error response (`/fallback/unavailable`) on failure.
- Requests to `/legacy/products/**` route to the legacy service with path rewriting and its own circuit breaker with fallback.

This setup ensures balanced load distribution and graceful degradation across services, maintaining availability and system stability.
