# üîó Microservices

This code represents a microservices-based e-commerce application, specifically focusing on the **Cart** and **Products** modules, along with an **API Gateway** for managing requests. Each module operates as an independent service, communicating via REST APIs.

## üìÇ General Structure:

### üîπ Microservices Architecture:
- The application is divided into independent services: **Cart Service** and **Products Service**.
- Each service has its own database and is responsible for a specific domain.
- Services communicate via **REST APIs** and are orchestrated by an **API Gateway**.
- Uses **Spring Boot** and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for service routing and request management.
- Leverages a **Config Server** to manage centralized, externalized configuration for all microservices, ensuring consistent settings across environments.
- Integrates **Spring Security** at the **API Gateway** level to centralize authentication and authorization across all services (basic authentication is used for simplicity, as the focus is on the microservices architecture rather than advanced security mechanisms).



## üåê Core Components:

### üõí Cart Service:
- Manages shopping carts for users.
- Supports cart creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Uses **CartEntity, CartProductEntity, CartUserEntity** for persistence.
- Mappers (**CartMapper, CartProductMapper, CartUserMapper**) convert between entities and models.
- REST Controller (**CartRestController**) exposes cart-related endpoints.
- Service (**CartService**) contains business logic.
- Stores data in its own **Cart Database**.

### üè¨ Products Service:
- Manages product information and inventory.
- Updates stock quantities after purchases.
- Uses **ProductEntity** for persistence.
- REST Controller (**ProductRestController**) exposes product-related endpoints.
- Service (**ProductService**) contains business logic.
- Stores data in its own **Products Database**.

### üöÄ API Gateway:
- Serves as a single entry point for all client requests.
- Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Provides security, rate limiting, and logging features.
- Uses **Spring Cloud Gateway** for dynamic routing and load balancing.
- Defines routes for **Cart** and **Products** services.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Config Server:
- Centralized configuration service using **Spring Cloud Config Server**.
- Manages external properties for all microservices from a shared Git repository or local file system.
- Enables consistent and environment-specific configuration management.
- Supports dynamic configuration updates without requiring service redeployment.

## üîó Service Communication:
- The **Gateway** is the contact point for clients.
- To access product information, the client makes a request to the Gateway (`/products/**`), which then routes it to the **Products Microservice** (running on `http://localhost:8081`).
- To interact with shopping carts, the client makes a request to the Gateway (`/carts/**`), which then routes it to the **Cart Microservice** (running on `http://localhost:8082`).
- The **Products** and **Cart** microservices are independent of each other in this shown architecture. No direct communication between them is observed in the provided files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

- **Spring Boot:** Base framework for building Java applications quickly.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway:** Provides API routing and security for the microservices 
- **Spring Cloud Config Server:** Centralized server for managing external configuration in a microservices architecture. Allows applications to retrieve configuration properties from a shared repository, making configuration management more efficient and consistent across environments.architecture.
- **Spring Security:** Framework for authentication and authorization.
- **Brave OTLP:** Library for instrumentation and export of distributed tracing using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP).




## üîß Running the Project

Execute the project with Gradle:

## üìå Running microservices individually

Execute cloud servers and microservices one by one with Gradle:

```bash

# tests
./gradlew test

# run app
./gradlew bootRun

```

## üöÄ Running the Complete Microservice Infrastructure

```bash

# start infra and microservices
docker compose up -d

# Make a GET request to the API Gateway to gain access to the microservices.
 curl -X GET -u "customer:customer"  "http://localhost:8080/products" -v

```



## üìäüîç Observability Dashboard

You can access the Grafana dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to monitor the application's observability data in real time. The system integrates the following tools:

- **Prometheus** for collecting and querying metrics.
- **Loki** for centralized logging and log aggregation.
- **Tempo** for distributed tracing and visualization of request flows across microservices.

These tools work together to provide a comprehensive view of the system's performance, logs, and traces, all accessible through a unified Grafana interface.

## üìå Summary
This microservices-based application provides a scalable and maintainable structure for **Cart** and **Products** management. It utilizes **Spring Boot** for microservice implementation and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for API management. The architecture also incorporates **Spring Cloud Config Server** for centralized external configuration management, ensuring consistency and ease of configuration updates across all microservices.

### üß© Microservices

- **cart-ms**: Handles all operations related to the shopping cart, including adding, updating, and removing items.
- **products-ms**: Manages product information such as details, availability, and pricing.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Infrastructure Services

- **checkout-gateway**: Serves as the API gateway, managing routing, load balancing, and security between clients and microservices.
- **config-server**: Centralized configuration service powered by Spring Cloud Config Server, providing externalized configuration for all microservices.
